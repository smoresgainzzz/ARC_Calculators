# ARC Calculators

This project contains a set of simple, browser-based fitness calculators designed to support users of the ARC (Adaptive Rotation Cycle) training system.

## Tools Included

### 1. Estimated 1RM Calculator
Calculates your estimated one-rep max (1RM) using:
- **Brzycki formula** for ≤10 reps
- **Epley formula** for >10 reps

### 2. Carb Cycling Macro Calculator
Customizes daily protein, carbohydrate, and fat intake based on:
- Your bodyweight
- Your current goal (Cut, Recomp, or Gain)
- The day’s carb level (Low, Moderate, or High)

### 3. Target Load Calculator
Helps to calculate workload based on chosen reps, using:
- Your 1RM (from Estimated 1RM Calculator)
- Your target reps

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.).
2. Enter your information in the calculators.
3. Read your estimated 1RM and personalized macronutrient targets.
4. No data is stored — this runs entirely in your browser.
